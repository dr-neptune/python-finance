#+TITLE: Chapter 21: Market-Based Valuation

A major task in derivatives analytics is the market-based valuation of options and derivatives that are not liquidly traded. To this end, one generally calibrates a pricing model to market quotes of liquidly traded options and uses the calibrated model for the pricing of the non-traded options.

This chapter is divided into sections that implement the following major tasks:

Options Data
  We need the DAX 30 stock index itself and the European options on the index

Model Calibration
  To value the non-traded options in a market-consistent fashion, one generally first
  calibrates the chosen model to quoted option prices in such a way that the model based on the
  optimal parameters replicates the market prices as well as possible

Portfolio Valuation
  The final task is to model and value the non-traded options; important risk measures are also
  estimated on a position and portfolio level

* Options Data
